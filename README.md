[Games Done Quick (GDQ)](https://gamesdonequick.com/) is a regular
speedrunning event that collects money for charity. The event is incredibly
fun, especially if you enjoy seeing your favourite games torn to shreds by
amazing runners and supported with great commentary and prizes to win.

This [Matrix](https://matrix.org) bot lets you:
* Query for information about the current/upcoming GDQ schedule
* Announces upcoming events into all joined rooms (except if rooms have less
  than three participants because that's our heuristic for a DM)

You can invite [`@gdqbot:ecef.xyz`](https://matrix.to/#/@gdqbot:ecef.xyz) into a
channel or come hang out in [`#gdq:ecef.xyz`](https://matrix.to/#/#gdq:ecef.xyz).
You can also run your own bot.

This bot is built using the [GDQ Go library](https://github.com/daenney/gdq).

## Installation

There are prebuilt binaries as well as Docker images available for every release
from v0.1.4 onwards. You can find them [over here](https://github.com/daenney/gdqbot/releases).

|Platform|Architecture|Binary|Docker
|---|---|---|---|
|Windows|amd64|‚úÖ|‚ùå|
|macOS|amd64|‚úÖ|‚ùå|
|macOS|arm64/M1|‚úÖ|‚ùå|
|Linux|amd64|‚úÖ|‚úÖ|
|Linux|arm64|‚úÖ|‚úÖ|
|Linux|armv7/amrhf|‚úÖ|‚úÖ|

In order to run the bot you'll need an access token for the bot's Matrix account:

```sh
$ GDQBOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=$(curl -s --data '{"identifier": {"type": "m.id.user", "user": "<localpart>" }, "password": "<password>", "type": "m.login.password", "device_id": "GDQBot", "initial_device_display_name": "GDQBot"}' https://<homeserver.tld>/_matrix/client/r0/login | jq -r '.access_token')
```

### Docker

All Docker images use [distroless as the base](https://github.com/GoogleContainerTools/distroless)
and builds on the `nonroot` version of the image. This means the bot never
runs as root, regardless of user remapping/user namespacing. This image
can/should be run as read-only.

#### `docker run`

```sh
$ docker run --rm --name gdqbot \
	--cap-drop=ALL \
	--read-only \
	-e GDQBOT_ACCESS_TOKEN \
	ghcr.io/daenney/gdqbot:<arch>-<tag> \
	-homeserver <domain.tld> \
	-user @<bot>:<domain.tld>
```

The `-e GDQBOT_ACCESS_TOKEN` will read that environment variable from
your current environment and set it in the environment of the container.

You can instead pass `--env-file` which should point to a file containing any
environment variables you want set. In this case, it should have
`GDQBOT_ACCESS_TOKEN=<value>`.

#### `docker-compose`

```yaml
---
version: "2.0"

services:
  gdqbot:
    image: ghcr.io/daenney/gdqbot:<arch>-<tag>
    container_name: gdqbot
    restart: unless-stopped
    command:
      - -homeserver https://example.com
      - -user @gdqbot:example.com
    environment:
      - GDQBOT_ACCESS_TOKEN
    cap_drop:
      - ALL
    read_only: true
```

Just like with `docker run`, you can use `env_file` instead.

## Building

You can `go get` the code, or `git clone` and then run a `go build` followed
by a `go test` to ensure everything is OK.

You can build the bot using `go build -trimpath` or install it directly using
`go install github.com/daenney/gdqbot`. See `go help install` for where the
binaries will end up.

To embed the version, commit and date at build time you'll need to add
`-X main.version=VERSION -X main.commit=SHA -X main.date=DATE` and compute
the right values yourself.

## Contributing

* Make small commits that encapsulate one functional change at a time
  (implementation change, the associated tests and any doc changes)
* Every commit explains what it's trying to achieve and why
* The tests pass
